title: "The Basic SELECT"
---

Where every course in SQL begins, the `SELECT` statement. We'll then venture into other basic functions.

Let's practice some SQL queries on the Northwinds Database.

# Concepts

## Basic SELECT

### Example 1
---

**Query**

```
SELECT * from employees;
```

**Result**: returns all rows and all columns.

---

### Example 2
---

**Query**

```
SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected columns.

---

## Expressions

### Example 1 - Functions
---

**Query**

```
SELECT last_name, first_name, hire_date, current_date,
  date_part('month', hire_date)
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with just the month of the date the employee was hired.

---


### Example 2 - Math Equations
---

**Query**

```
SELECT order_id, unit_price, quantity,
  unit_price * quantity
  from order_details;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with the unit_price times the quantity (i.e. total sales).

---

## Column Aliases

### Example 1 - Functions (with Alias)
---

**Query**

```
SELECT last_name, first_name, hire_date, current_date,
  date_part('month', hire_date) as "Hire Month"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with just the month of the date the employee was hired.

---

### Example 2 - Math Equations (with Alias)
---

**Query**

```
SELECT order_id, unit_price, quantity,
  unit_price * quantity as "Total Value"
  from order_details;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with the unit_price times the quantity (i.e. total sales).

---

## Concatenation

### Example 1 - Function
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns a new column named "Name" with the employee's first and last name concatenated together with a space between the name portions.

---

### Example 2 - Syntax
---

**Query**

```
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as "Name"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns a new column named "Name" with the employee's first and last name concatenated together with a space between the name portions.

---


## Comments

### Example 1 - Single Line Comment
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
--- this is concatenating the first and last name
  from employees;
```

**Result**: single line comment only visible in the query code text, not in output.

---

### Example 2 - Multi-Line Comment
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
/* this is concatenating the first and last name
so that the names are combined */
  from employees;
```

**Result**: multi-line comment only visible in the query code text, not in output.

# Labs

## Lab 1

### Question 1

**Question**

List all the products in the North Winds database showing product_id, product_name, quantity_per_unit, unit_price, and units_in_stock.

**Answer**:

```
SELECT product_id, product_name, quantity_per_unit, unit_price, units_in_stock
  FROM products;
```

### Question 2

**Question**

For all employees at North Winds, list the first name and last name concatenated together with a blank space in-between, and the YEAR when they were hired.

**Answer**:

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as name,
  date_part('year', hire_date)
  FROM employees;
```

### Question 3

**Question**

For all products in the North Winds database, list the product_name, unit_price, units_in_stock, and the total value of the inventory of that product as "total_value".

`Hint: total_value = units_in_stock * unit_price`

**Answer**:

```
SELECT product_name, unit_price, units_in_stock,
  units_in_stock * unit_price as total_value
  FROM products;
```

### Question 4

**Question**

For all employees at North Winds, list the first and last name concatenated together with a blank space between under column header "name", and the name of the month (spelled out) for each employee's birthday.

**Answer**:

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as name,
  --- date_part('month', birth_date) will return the number month
  --- to_char(birth_date, 'month') will return the month spelled out, in lowercase
  --- to_char(birth_date, 'Month') will return the month spelled out, in proper case
  --- to_char(birth_date, 'MONTH') will return the month spelled out, in uppercase
  to_char(birth_date, 'Month')
  FROM employees;
```
