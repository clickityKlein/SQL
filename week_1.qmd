title: "The Basic SELECT"
---

Where every course in SQL begins, the `SELECT` statement. We'll then venture into other basic functions.

Let's practice some SQL queries on the Northwinds Database.

# Concepts

## Basic SELECT

### Example 1
---

**Query**

```
SELECT * from employees;
```

**Result**: returns all rows and all columns.

---

### Example 2
---

**Query**

```
SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected columns.

---

## Expressions

### Example 1 - Functions
---

**Query**

```
SELECT last_name, first_name, hire_date, current_date,
  date_part('month', hire_date)
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with just the month of the date the employee was hired.

---


### Example 2 - Math Equations
---

**Query**

```
SELECT order_id, unit_price, quantity,
  unit_price * quantity
  from order_details;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with the unit_price times the quantity (i.e. total sales).

---

## Column Aliases

### Example 1 - Functions (with Alias)
---

**Query**

```
SELECT last_name, first_name, hire_date, current_date,
  date_part('month', hire_date) as "Hire Month"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with just the month of the date the employee was hired.

---

### Example 2 - Math Equations (with Alias)
---

**Query**

```
SELECT order_id, unit_price, quantity,
  unit_price * quantity as "Total Value"
  from order_details;
```

**Result**: returns selected column and a new column with the unit_price times the quantity (i.e. total sales).

---

## Concatenation

### Example 1 - Function
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns a new column named "Name" with the employee's first and last name concatenated together with a space between the name portions.

---

### Example 2 - Syntax
---

**Query**

```
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as "Name"
  from employees;
```

**Result**: returns a new column named "Name" with the employee's first and last name concatenated together with a space between the name portions.

---


## Comments

### Example 1 - Single Line Comment
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
--- this is concatenating the first and last name
  from employees;
```

**Result**

---

### Example 2 - Multi Line Comment
---

**Query**

```
SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name) as "Name"
/* this is concatenating the first and last name
so that the names are combined */
  from employees;
```

**Result**
