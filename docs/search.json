    "text": "GROUP BY\nWe’ve previously seen that Group Functions summarize values in an interim answer set return values grouped across many rows. The GROUP BY clause enables SQL to provide subtotals. It can perform the group function across a subset of rows in the interim answer set and provide a total for each subset of rows.\nTo avoid mismatch, remember this rule:\nWhen using a GROUP BY, every column/expression in the SELECT statement must either be:\n\na group function\na column that is being grouped by\n\nAlso remember that even though the group function is sorting the interim answer set in order to calculate the totals, we must still use an order by clause to list the totals in group sequence."
